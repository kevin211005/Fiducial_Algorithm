# Fiducial Algorithm
The repo stores the Fiducial Algorithm for ECG.

Our goals is Using Fiducail feature to reproduce the while ECG data.  

Fiducal.py is a script to get the fiducial feature, which are some meanful info from ECG.  

Other scripts are using the fiducail feature to reporduce the whole ECG data.  

Fiducial points and original ECG data.
